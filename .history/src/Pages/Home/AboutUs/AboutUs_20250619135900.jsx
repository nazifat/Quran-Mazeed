        Connecting Hearts to the Quran, One Verse at a Time
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          The rise of Muslims to the zenith of civilization in a period of four decades
          was based on Islam&apos;s emphasis on learning. This is clear when we reflect on the Qur&apos;an and the sayings of Prophet Muhammad ï·º, 
          which are filled with encouragement toward knowledge, education, and observation. 
          Our mission is to make Quran learning accessible, engaging, and rooted in authentic understanding.
